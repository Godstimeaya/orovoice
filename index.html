<p>History has it that by 2370 BC Oro also known as (Oro Nation) had already been settled down in the present location known as Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria 
on the West Coast of African Sub Region, Akwa Ibom Gulf Line to Gulf of Guinea Atlantic Ocean South, after the Great flood (Noah's deluge).
The Oron Nation is an ethnic nationality which is said to have migrated from the east through Central Eastern Africa (around the Congos) and through the 
Southern regions of the Camerouns to present-day area of South-Southern Nigeria. The Oro land and its people consist of 9 Clans called Afaha. These are; 
Afaha Okpo, Afaha Ukwong, Ebughu, Afaha Ibighi, Effiat, Afaha Ubodung, Etta, Afaha Oki-uso, and Afaha Idua (Ilue).

			 <h1>Our Destiny: In Our Hands</h1>
<p>Residents of Oron, one of the oil-producing local councils in Akwa Ibom, has protested against alleged 
marginalisation by the state government and the International Oil Companies, IOCs operating in the area.
The protesters were drawn from the five council areas of Mbo, Okobo, Udung Uko, Urue Offong-Oruko and Oron,
who disrupted economic and other activities in Oron and its environs.
The protesters, who were dressed in black, also displayed many placards, including “Is oil thicker than blood?
Oro youth say no to continued marginalisation, “Akwa Ibom Government is a threat to peace".

<p>The Oros are peculiar people, strong contenders in nature wherever they are found, with the accolade `Oro Ukpabang Okpo`. 
Oro man complexion is not reflecting other ethnic nationalities or immigrant somewhere into Oro Nation. 
Their complexion is not as fair as the Palestinians or of the Israelis nor as dark as people residing around 
Cameroon mountain when Oro Nation had already came into being after creation of the world, even before pre 
colonialism came to being, when Nigeria and Cameroon did not come into existence as Countries. Abang was a warrior so powerful with huge muscles, 
the Head and Chief wrestler known as `Mbok’. The wrestling known as (Mbok) was originated by Abang the warrior from Africa which was displayed by the African slaves after a day`s job, 
to the admiration of the Guards who watches over them at work thereby creating relaxation chances for them at work before it spread and developed as wrestling around the whole world today. 
Abang the warrior with his group gallantly fought against the slave masters who were in the area for slave trade business. One day, he was over powered and captured with few of his group and 
were taken to the present day Israel of what was then Egypt. This is perhaps why it may be more than a mere coincidence that the only two nations on earth with places named “Oron” are
 Israel and Nigeria.</p><a href="https://www.ibomtourism.com.ng/2014/11/african-takwaendo-mbok_5.html"><u>Read More...</a></u></p>

He is known as the 'Ahta Oro'. The Ahta has all the Ofong (Ivong or Ifong) 
afaha and the paramount rulers as members of his traditional rulers council.
 Some high chiefs (for example, Ikpoto, Akpaha and Okete Okete) are also recognized

<p>The Oron people have a unique culture and tradition. The Ekpe Society, 
which was shared with the Efiks and the Southern Igbos as well as the Ibibios,
is used throughout Oron Land as the authority. There are other traditional 
cults and societies which include the Ekpo, Abang, Edeme Awan Ñkwuho, Ekong, 
Afiakegit, Kongoma, Mbok, Ababa, Nnabo, and many others. All these societies, 
in addition to the unique hospitality of the Oron people, their arts, rich diet, 
Oil and Gas minerals, have been known to attract tourism and commerce to the area 
and Akwa Ibom state in general. The Oron people have a very colourful mode of traditional dressing, especially with an Iyara (which is red in colour).
The red Iyara is usually worn with a white tailored traditional shirt and y a
wrapper (large fabric wrapped around the waist) to match.

This is most evident in the establishment of the Hope Waddell Training Institute , 
Calabar in 1895 and the Methodist Boys' High School, Oron in 1905. 
These schools are two of the oldest in the history of Nigeria and attracted students

<p>Oron is rich in oil and natural gas. Most of its oil reserves are 
off-shore. There are 25 corked oil wells. Oron is presently rated 
as having one of the highest supplies of natural gas deposits in 
sub-Saharan Africa with large amounts of untapped natural gas and 
oil at Ukpata, Udung Okung, and Edik Ekpu.
The region is extremely fertile and is known for its topographical 
Oil Palm Belt, tropical rainforest, swamps, and beaches. 
The mangrove forests also provide timber and raw materials for 
medicinal purposes. There are also deposits of solid minerals such 
as iron, free silica or glass sand and gravel. Seafoods such as crayfish, 
snipers, oyster and periwinkle abound richly in all coastal areas.

<p>Oron is found in the flood plain of South Eastern Nigeria, 
with the land mainly intersected by numerous streams and 
tributaries flowing into Cross River. The entire coastline 
stretches from Uya Oron to Udung Uko.
Oron is in the tropical region and has a uniformly high 
temperature all the year round. The two main seasons are 
the dry which spans between October and April and wet 
season which starts around May and ends in September. 
There are also two prevailing winds – the South-West 
onshore winds which brings heavy rains and the 
North- East trade winds blowing across the Sahara Desert, 
which brings in the dry season.

<p>Abandonment of tripod political appointments, dating back 27 years 
to the creation of Akwa Ibom State – which buttered the bread of the 
three major ethnic groups: Ibibio, Anang, and Oron – has left Oron dazed. 
Oron is shouting from the rooftop for justice, amid suggestion for it to 
think outside the box, in a miasma of ethnic politics stoked by the Peoples
Democratic Party (PDP) adopting a new zoning formula</p>

The first National Museum east of the Niger and the 
Maritime Academy of Nigeria are located in Oron.
The Ekpe initiates used a written expression known as Nsibidi.
